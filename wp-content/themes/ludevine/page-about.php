		<p>LUDEVINE IS A JEWELRY LINE BY SHAHLA KAREEN. THROUGH HER CREATIONS, SHAHLA TELLS TALES OF PAST AND FUTURE, EVOKING A DEEP SENSE OF TIMELESSNESS AND MYSTERY, CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF CRAFTSMANSHIP.

THE LUDEVINE LINE IS MADE UP OF THREE COLLECTIONS, EACH ONE WITH A DIFFERENT CONCEPT, BUT ALL OF THEM TIED TOGETHER BY THE FEELING THEY CONJURE UP â€” THAT OUR REALITY IS NOT NECESSARILY THE ONLY REALITY AND THAT HISTORY AS WELL AS AN IMAGINARY FUTURE HAS A LOT TO TELL US OF WHO WE ARE AND WANT TO BE.
