A nomadic artist, Shahla wanted to create something that reflected the stories and lessons she has collected in her travels and in her life.  The designer believes that these narratives are rich  and deserve the utmost acknowledgment  - and she translates that through ornate details and decadence.  “My life is about indulgence and love and my creations translate my appreciation for that”</p>		<p>The name of the line encompasses what Shahla is about.  “Devine” in french means to wonder - and Shahla’s premier collection PRIMITIVE  leaves a lot to the imagination; pieces created out of 185 million year old  ammonite fossils, actual sea horses, and bear molars - jewelery crafted to enchant.  The concept behind the word “Lewd” reveals the audacity of the designer’s experiences. The narratives that Shahla embed into her work are an allegory of her own adventures “I am a straight forward person and I tell it like it is.  I realize my reality may not be standard or common, but it is a perspective worth telling.  My jewels reflect that: sentimental and profound - yet discreet in their intentions so that whoever wears the jewelery can create their own connection to it” </p>		</div>		</center>	</div>	</center></div><!-- #primary --><?php	 	 get_footer(); ?><script></script>
